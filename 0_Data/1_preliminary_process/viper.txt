Software Requirements Specification 
1.	Introduction
1.1	Purpose
The purpose of this document is to fully describe the external behavior of the SCM system in terms of functional requirements. It also describes the nonfunctional requirements such as usability, availability, security, maintainability and reliability. In addition, it specifies the design constraints and standards that are needed to be applied on SCM.
1.2	Scope
This document represents specification of the SCM system requirements. It serves as the baseline document on which the subsequent software development life cycle phases are built.

1.5	Overview
This SRS document is organized as flows: 

 Overall description of SCM which include product perspective, product functions, SCM’s user characteristics, constraints, assumptions & dependencies and apportioning of requirements.

  Specific Requirements which include , interface requirements, functional requirements,  performance requirements, logical database requirements, design constraints and software system attributes.

  Change management process.

2. Overall Description


2.1 Product Perspective:
The perspective of  product conduct in delivering Ejada company products like IT products, Business Consultation and other IT service in fast way and less cost than other alternative way. There are other well known SCM systems from Oracle and SAP, they are used in big companies and connecting with other systems but with the same main functionality that is provided by our SCM. Our system scope is limited by Ejada and there requests.
 

2.2 Product Functions
	
Ejada SCM will:
•	Provide a simple Customer service management process 
•	Determine mutually satisfying goals between organization and customers 
•	Establish and maintain customer rapport
•	Produce positive feelings in the organization and the customers
•	Maintain Procurement process 
•	Manage Product development and commercialization 
•	Coordinate with customer relationship management to identify customer-articulated needs
•	select materials and suppliers in conjunction with procurement 
•	Develop production technology in manufacturing flow to manufacture and integrate into the best supply chain flow for the product/market combination. 
•	Maintain Manufacturing flow management process 
•	Manage Physical distribution 
•	Maintain Outsourcing and Partnerships 
•	Maintain Measurement Performance 
•	Maintain Cost Performance 
•	Maintain Customer Service Performance
•	Maintain Productivity measures Performance 
•	Maintain Asset measurement Performance 
•	Maintain Quality Performance
 

 

 

2.3 User Characteristics

The users are Ejada’s employees, customers and suppliers. It considers that they have the high school level or higher and they can read and write in English with basic knowledge of using computer programs.

2.4 Constraints

The system has many constraints. For example, the system must be web-based and all tools must be compliant with .Net technologies, i.e., We must use ASP.NET and C# as programming language and MS SQL as DBMS. We are also constrained with Ejada's framework and the system will later be integrated with other two modules in the framework. Ejada has some programming standards that we must commit to.

2.5 Assumptions & Dependencies

	We assume that the server machine of the system has a suitable Microsoft OS. This machine has a connection to internet.

2.6 Apportioning of Requirements

Our SCM system requires including all requirements prior to the first delivery.

3.3 Performance Requirements
The system must handle at least 100 concurrent users and their operations. The system must accomplish 90% for transactions in less than 1 second. This is due to the nature of data, which is only text information that does not usually exceed 50 KB per transaction.


3.4 Logical Database Requirements
The DB tables shall reflect following:

3.5.4	Ejada framework:
The system has to use the Ejada .Net frame work and also our system will integrate with two modules in Ejada. 

3.6 Software System Attributes

3.6.1	Reliability
All data will be backed-up everyday automatically and also the system administrator can back-up the data as a function for him. Also if any errors, fault or failures happen the system will detected and inform the user about problems and also if there is any transaction with the database and in that time happen no action to the data and the system will back to the previous state of database. Also our system will cover the quality assurance. 

3.6.2	Availability
